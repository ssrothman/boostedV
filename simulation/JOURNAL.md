## 2026-11-11 A.2 setup and DataFormats
- Plan: `stepA2_plan.md`. New local repos (remotes pending): `EECDataFormats` (pkg `SRothman/DataFormats`),
  `JetSetup`, `EventSelection`; symlinked into `eecdev/CMSSW_15_0_22/src/SRothman/`.
- genreflex in 15_0 rejects explicit `std::array<double,N>` selections ("I/O is supported transparently").
- DataFormats tests: ROOT file round-trip of `EECJetCollection` and every EEC result vector. Mutations
  (eta→rapidity in `jetPseudoJet`, dropped charge, removed `UnbinnedResult<2>` dictionary) each fail the tests.

## 2026-11-11 EECs plugins and JetSetup
- EECs plugins and CovarianceAccumulator: see `EECs/JOURNAL.md` (2026-11-11 entries).
- Dev input: 2000 events of the DY MLM Summer22EE MiniAODv4 file, copied to
  `~/nobackup/boostedV/testdata/DYto2L-4Jets_MLL-50_MLM_Summer22EE_2000ev.root`.
- MiniAOD facts measured on that file:
  - Daughters of `slimmedJetsAK8`/`slimmedJetsPuppi` are unweighted packed candidates. Σ(puppiWeight·p) reproduces the raw jet pt (AK8 within 0.17%, 24 jets).
  - `slimmedJetsAK8` has no daughters for pt < 170 (`applySubstructure_cff.py: dropDaughters "pt < 170"`). The translator throws on such jets.
  - Gen-jet p4 vs the sum of its packed daughters differs by up to 2.7e-4 (packing precision; seen in double precision via FWLite).
  - Reclustering packedGenParticles without neutrinos (anti-kt 0.8) reproduces `slimmedGenJetsAK8` within 1.4e-4. PUPPI-weighted packedPFCandidates reproduce the `slimmedJetsAK8` raw pt with median 1.5e-4 and p95 7e-4.
  - ID names present: `cutBasedElectronID-RunIIIWinter22-V1-*`, `cutBasedPhotonID-RunIIIWinter22-122X-V1-*`. HLT paths present: IsoMu24_v15, Ele32_WPTight_Gsf_v17, AK8PFJet500_v18, PFHT1050_v20, Photon200_v15. All Run-3 `Flag_*` MET filters are present in the PAT TriggerResults.
- JME correctionlib keys (Summer22EE): `Summer22EE_22Sep2023_V2_MC_Total_AK8PFPuppi` and `..._JRV1_MC_{ScaleFactor,PtResolution}_AK8PFPuppi`. JME also ships `jetid.json.gz`; we use `PFJetIDSelectionFunctor` RUN3PUPPIruns2022FGruns2023CD instead.
- JetSetup mutations caught (6/6): JES sign, JER matching, lepton veto, chargedOnly, seed salt, JER systematic. A mutation that does not compile reuses the stale binary, so it must be redone.

## 2026-11-11 EventSelection and end-to-end validation
- EventSelection on 2000 inclusive DY events: Zmumu 217, Zee 102, Wmunu 44, Wenu 6, Hadronic 0 (trigger 0), GammaJets 0. The Z boson mass means are 90.5 (μμ) and 90.1 (ee).
  Z→μμ agrees event by event with an independent FWLite selection (217 = 217).
- Trap: in PyROOT, `m.passed(ROOT.reco.Muon.CutBasedIdTight)` passes the int 3 to the bitmask overload `passed(uint64_t)`, so it tests Loose|Medium. Use `1 << int(enum)`.
- EventSelection mutations caught: 6/6 (veto, OS, AND/OR, nMax, mT sign, closest mass).
- `configs/eecNano_cfg.py` end to end:
  - 1000 events of DY PTLL-400to600 (`~/nobackup/boostedV/testdata/DYto2L-4Jets_MLL-50_PTLL-400to600_MLM_Summer22EE_1000ev.root`): 17 s, 1.4 GB RSS (single thread, 5 reco variations + gen, 3 observables each).
  - Brute force from NANO constituents, about 600 jets per level: reco E2C/E3C/E1C ≤ 5e-8; gen E2C 5.6e-5, gen E3C 1.4e-4 (single-tuple bin-edge migrations from float-stored inputs).
  - Gen E1C: 2 of 609 jets each have exactly one particle in the adjacent bin.
  - Sum rules hold to 1e-6. The Zmumu aggregator H, C and Σw match the NANO recomputation (rtol 1e-4; Generator_weight is stored with 14 mantissa bits).
- E1C rest-frame angles are badly conditioned for boosted light jets. Perturbing the jet four-vector by 6e-8 (relative) moved one jet's E1C by 0.19 (L1), so recomputing E1C downstream from float NANO jets is not reliable. Computing the reference in float32 numpy gave a 0.19 false alarm.
- `GenWeightsTableProducer` warns at beginRun about reading `LHERunInfoProduct` before endRun. The Runs tree still has `genEventCount` = processed events and `genEventSumw`.

## 2026-11-11 Placeholder constituent variations, selection overrides
- At the user's request, the constituent-variation sizes are invented placeholders (`JetSetup` `CONSTITUENT_VARIATIONS`): charged-hadron drop 2%; charged, neutral and photon scales ±1%, ±5%, ±2%. The selection defaults stay as proposed.
- The drop uses `seedSalt=1`. With salt 0, its first draw would come from the same seed as the JER stochastic smearing of the same jet.
- `addAllChannels` now forwards `objectCuts`, `metFilters`, `triggers` and `channelCuts`; unknown names raise.
- On 1000 PTLL-400to600 events: each scale variation changes only its category, by exactly its factor. TrkDrop removed 1.91% of 15356 charged hadrons (expected 2.0 ± 0.11%) and nothing else. All end-to-end checks pass. Wall time is 21 s (17 s before) with 7 more reco chains.
- `testdata/` is gitignored in boostedV; `~/nobackup/boostedV` is the repo itself.

## 2026-11-11 Single YAML analysis configuration
- `configs/default.yaml` is the only source of physics settings, with `config=` on the `cmsRun` line. Schema in `analysis.schema.yaml` (jsonschema 4.22 and PyYAML 6.0.1 are in CMSSW_15_0_22; there is no `tomllib` on Python 3.9).
- The package helpers no longer have defaults. They take dicts: `addSelection`/`addChannel` (generic channel types), `setupJets(spec)`, `addObservable`/`addAggregator`.
- Regression: `default.yaml` reproduces the previous hard-coded setup exactly. 1000 PTLL-400to600 events give an identical output: 1309 Events branches, 192 Runs branches and 572 histogram objects compared value by value.
- `test_analysisConfig.py` (9 tests) checks that no tracked parameter of any SRothman module falls back to `fillDescriptions`: 200+ modules in MC, 45 in data. Omitting `rhoMax`, `idMask` or `maxBins` in a helper fails it.
- Traps:
  - `edmConfigDump` does not define `__file__`; use `inspect.currentframe().f_code.co_filename`.
  - Generated cfis carry the untracked `mightGet`.
  - `cms.InputTag('').value()` is `'""'`.
  - `__pycache__/*.pyc` from `scram b python` had been committed to EECs, JetSetup and EventSelection; they are now untracked and ignored.
- The validation configs in JetSetup and EventSelection take `config=` too. Their checks pass with the same numbers, except the 50% drop test, whose `seedSalt` changed (0.514 kept).

## 2026-11-11 Generator-level selections
- Design choices made with the user:
  - Gen objects come from the Rivet particle level (`ParticleLevelProducer`, as in NanoAOD): dressed prompt leptons (ΔR 0.1), isolated prompt photons, MET from prompt neutrinos.
  - Gen cuts mirror the reco kinematics.
  - Jets are cleaned against their own level's objects.
  - Aggregation is per channel and level, for all jet collections.
- `selection.levels` = [reco] | [gen] | [reco, gen] picks which levels define written and aggregated events. Both levels are always evaluated in MC.
- Trap: `GenParticles2HepMCConverter` needs `PDTRecord`. `addGenCommon` loads `SimGeneral.HepPDTESSource.pythiapdt_cfi`.
- 1000 PTLL-400to600 events:
  - reco-only writes 466 events, gen-only 677 and OR 727, with 416 in both. OR = reco ∪ gen exactly.
  - Zmumu: reco and gen 198, reco only 0, gen only 49. Zee: 153 / 0 / 95.
  - Gen Z→μμ vs bare prompt muons (FWLite): 247 vs 243 selected, with 996 of 1000 events agreeing.
  - The Rivet chain adds about 10 s per 1000 events (25 s → 35 s).
- Regression: reco-only reproduces the previous run's 466 events. All 1254 non-gen branches and all 144 reco histograms are identical (the histogram directories are now `<ch>_reco_…`). Gen observables change because gen jets are now cleaned against gen objects.
- End-to-end checks pass in OR mode (36 checks, including aggregation at both levels). The config tests (13) cover the levels, data behaviour, gen schema and per-level cleaning.
